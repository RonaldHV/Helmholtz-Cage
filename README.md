# Magnetic field generated by a Helmholtz cage

Here we show how to generate a magnetic field using a Helmholtz cage, and then control its magnitude and direction. '[Simulation of the magnetic field generated by square shape Helmholtz coils](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X16303389)', from 2016. The paper describes the procedure for determining the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at any point around a set of conductors forming a Helmholtz square coil using the Biot-Savart law.

To describe and understand the process, we will begin by describing the magnetic field around a conductor and increase the complexity of the assembly until we reach the cage. 

## Magnetic field around a wire

This [first notebook]() describes the magnetic field around a wire of length $L$, through which a current $I$ flows. The code is based on this [video](https://youtu.be/JsSdjm1XTNU?si=_5NFkUgog3IbaZAI) by Professor Rhett Allain. The figure depicts the magnetic field generated by the wire in the yz-plane (for illustrative purposes only).
